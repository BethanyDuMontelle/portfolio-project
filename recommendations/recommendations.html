				<q>Bethany is an extravagant programmer. She does what she wants. 
				She's resilient and doesn't even need coffee to get the job done. She
				once coded an RPG while hiking in the himalayas during a blizzard. 
				She got lost and kept programming in degrees -50 and under until the 
				rescue team found her, hiding in a cave 2000 feet above an icey trench. 
				That program went on to become Reltadune. She made a Balloon Popper 
				app whilst sitting on the edge of an active volcano in Hawaii. I would
				recommend her for all your programming needs.</q> <br />
